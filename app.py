        <h4>Rationale</h4>
        <p>Adoptive T cell therapies are transforming oncology, but their success against solid tumors is limited by poor persistence, exhaustion, and a hostile tumor microenvironment. To systematically identify genetic barriers to durable T cell function, we implemented a high-throughput CRISPR-based loss-of-function screening platform across multiple model systems.</p>
        <h4>Screening & Analytics</h4>
        <p>Using pooled CRISPR/Cas9 knockout libraries curated for relevance to T cell biology, we screened both CD3/CD28-stimulated primary T cells and tumor antigen specific TCR-T cells. Phenotypic readouts included proliferation, stemness, and durability. In silico analysis with MAGeCK quantified guide enrichment and identified candidate hits across donors and models.</p>
        <h4>Key Discoveries</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Gene target aliased as <b> GenT01</b> emerged as the strongest enhancer of stemness, expansion, and memory-like phenotypes when inactivated.</li>
        <li><b>GenT07</b> and <b>GenT10</b> promoted metabolic fitness, cytokine secretion, and sustained tumor-killing capacity.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>üåü Novelty of Dual Editing</h4>
        <p>Dual knockouts (<b>GenT01/GenT07</b> or <b>GenT01/GenT10</b>) synergized by retaining the stemness benefit of GenT01 loss while incorporating the functional/metabolic gains of GenT07 or GenT10. This combinatorial editing markedly improved expansion, cytokine polyfunctionality, and tumor control in vitro and in vivo.</p>
        <h4>Translational Impact</h4>
        <p>In xenograft and syngeneic models, GenT01/GenT10 dual knockout T cells exhibited superior peripheral persistence, enhanced tumor infiltration, and significantly improved tumor control compared to unedited or single KO cells.</p>
        <h4>Significance</h4>
        <p>This work establishes a scalable screening and computational analysis pipeline for rationally prioritizing genetic modifications that enhance T cell therapies. The combination of functional genomics, in silico target discovery, and rigorous in vivo validation paves the way for integrating multiplex knockout strategies into next-generation adoptive T cell platforms.</p>

        <div class="projectx-box">
        <h4>Problem & Setup</h4>
        <p>Human dermal fibroblasts were transdifferentiated by inducible MyoD. Genome-wide RNA-seq, DNase-seq, and MyoD ChIP-seq were generated in fibroblast, fibro-control, fibro-MyoD, and primary myoblasts to quantify how closely reprogrammed cells approach bona fide myoblasts.</p>
        <h4>Quantifying Chromatin Reprogramming (CRL)</h4>
        <p>The study introduces a chromatin reprogramming level (CRL) per differentially accessible DHS: the fraction of the fibroblast‚Üímyoblast accessibility difference achieved after MyoD induction (0 = not reprogrammed, 1 = fully reprogrammed). Distributions reveal a continuum, with higher median CRL for closing fibroblast-specific sites than for opening myoblast-specific sites.</p>
        <h4>Gene Expression Coupling (GRL)</h4>
        <p>An analogous gene reprogramming level (GRL) shows that promoter-proximal accessibility remodeling explains substantial variation in expression reprogramming (e.g., PCC ‚âà 0.6 at TSS ¬±2 kb for myoblast-specific genes).</p>
        <h4>Epigenetic Memory</h4>
        <p>Fibroblast identity features persist in both chromatin accessibility and transcriptome of fibro-MyoD, consistent with partial reprogramming and lineage memory.</p>
        <h4>MyoD Binding Predicts Chromatin Opening</h4>
        <p>MyoD binds both pre-open and previously closed regions; MyoD occupancy in fibro-MyoD correlates with CRL at myoblast-specific DHS (Spearman 0.66) and classifies reprogrammed vs non-reprogrammed sites with AUC ‚âà 0.96. Binding weakly predicts closing of fibroblast-specific sites.</p>
        <h4>Feature-Based Classification</h4>
        <p>Random Forest/Elastic Net models discriminate reprogrammed vs non-reprogrammed DHS using: (i) TF-motif features from PBM data (clustered over 140 TF families), (ii) pre-existing histone marks/CTCF/EZH2 in fibroblasts, and (iii) local DNase signal. Accuracies ‚âà81% (myoblast-specific) and ‚âà69% (fibroblast-specific).</p>
        <h4>Novel Predicted Drivers</h4>
        <p>Predictive features highlight MyoD/MRF E-box recognition plus cofactors (TCF3/E2A, MEIS1/PKNOX1) and SAND-domain factors (e.g., GMEB1/2, SP100/AIRE) at sites resistant to opening‚Äîsuggesting candidate factors to boost conversion efficiency.</p>
        <h4>Marker Dynamics</h4>
        <p>Early myogenic markers reprogram robustly, whereas intermediate/late muscle genes and many myoblast-specific enhancers remain suboptimally remodeled.</p>
        <h4>Use Cases for Reprogramming & Epigenetics</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Rational cocktail design: add MyoD cofactors/SAND proteins to target non-reprogrammed enhancers.</li>
        <li>CRISPRa/epigenome editing targeting: prioritize enhancers with low CRL near non-reprogrammed genes.</li>
        <li>QC/benchmarking: report CRL/GRL to quantify ‚Äúdistance to target fate.‚Äù</li>
        <li>Generalizable framework: apply CRL/GRL and feature-based classifiers to other conversions (e.g., fibroblast‚Üíneuron/hepatocyte) to diagnose chromatin bottlenecks.</li>

# <h4>Statistical Rigor/QC</h4>

        <h4>Problem & Framing</h4>
        <p>Time-series transcriptomics needs clustering that (i) doesn‚Äôt pre-specify the expected cluster number <b>K</b> and (ii) respects temporal correlation. The paper introduces <b>DPGP</b>‚Äîa Dirichlet-process Gaussian-process mixture that jointly infers the number of clusters and smooth trajectory structure.</p>
        <h4>Generative Model</h4>
        <p>Each cluster is a GP over time with cluster-specific mean and covariance. A Dirichlet process prior (default <b>ùõº=1</b>) governs mixture weights, yielding variable-size clusters and automatic complexity control. Missing or irregularly spaced time points are naturally handled.</p>
        <h4>Inference & Summarization</h4>
        <p>Posterior sampling uses Neal‚Äôs Algorithm 8 (Gibbs for DP mixtures). Kernel hyperparameters are updated by Type-II ML (marginal likelihood maximization via L-BFGS) with burn-in and thinning. Results are summarized by a MAP partition and a posterior similarity matrix (PSM) to quantify cluster-membership uncertainty and enable stability-aware downstream analysis.</p>
        <h4>Validation on Simulations</h4>
        <p>Across &gt;1,100 simulated datasets spanning diverse <b>K</b>, length scales, signal/marginal variances, and even t-distributed noise, DPGP/fDPGP achieved higher ARI than hierarchical, k-means, BHC, Mclust, GIMM, and SplineCluster baselines.</p>
        <h4>Software & Reproducibility</h4>
        <p>Open-source implementation is available (<a href="https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/DP_GP_cluster" target="_blank">GitHub</a>), facilitating adoption in routine RNA-seq/microarray time-course workflows.</p>
        <h4>üåü Novelty (Why This Matters)</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Unified nonparametric, time-aware clustering; no need to pre-set K.</li>
        <li>Uncertainty-aware outputs (PSM, credible bands) for robust biological interpretation.</li>
        <li>Kernelized flexibility to match biological dynamics; extensible to non-Gaussian processes.</li>
        <li>Practical scalability (fDPGP) without discarding temporal structure.</li>

# <h4>Scalability Variant</h4>
# <p>A marginalized implementation (<b>fDPGP</b>) swaps cluster-level for gene-level marginal likelihoods, reducing matrix-inversion cost and enabling larger studies; it was used for real-data applications in the paper.</p>

        <h4>Key Offering</h4>
        <p>RNA constructs encoding chimeric proteins composed of multiple antigens, immunogenic variants, or selected fragments from <b>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</b>, designed for in vivo expression to stimulate protective immunity.</p>
        <h4>Vaccine Design & Epitope Strategy</h4>
        <p>While the publicly available abstract provides only the high-level notion of chimeric antigen-encoding RNA, the inventive leap inherent in the patent lies in how these antigenic components are chosen and arranged‚Äîespecially through novel in silico workflows. These computational steps likely include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Epitope prediction:</b> Identifying both T-cell (CTL, HTL) and potentially B-cell epitopes derived from key Mtb proteins using immunoinformatic pipelines.</li>
        <li><b>Immunogenicity filtering:</b> Prioritizing epitopes for high-binding affinity to relevant human MHC alleles and minimal cross-reactivity or allergenicity.</li>
        <li><b>Chimeric design:</b> Algorithmically combining multiple epitope fragments‚Äîpossibly linked with rational linkers and optimized order‚Äîfor maximal antigen presentation.</li>
        <li><b>RNA sequence optimization:</b> Codon and RNA structural optimization for enhanced stability, translational efficiency, and expression in host cells.</li>
        <li><b>In silico validation:</b> Computational assessment of multi-epitope immunogenic potential and modeling of antigen presentation pathways or predicted immune responses.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These computational components represent the core novelty‚Äînot merely a mix of antigens, but an in silico‚Äìdriven rational design of an RNA vaccine specific for tuberculosis.</p>
        <h4>üåü Novelty & Significance for Immunologists</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Multi-antigen, epitope-level granularity:</b> By breaking down Mtb proteins into individual epitopes, the design ensures focused, relevant immune targeting rather than broad-spectrum antigenic noise.</li>
        <li><b>In silico groundwork:</b> The application of predictive bioinformatic tools to guide epitope selection and vaccine configuration reduces empirical trial-and-error‚Äîaccelerating development and potentially improving effectiveness and safety.</li>
        <li><b>RNA platform advantage:</b> Leveraging RNA for intracellular expression allows proper antigen processing through both MHC-I and MHC-II pathways, enhancing both cytotoxic and helper T-cell responses.</li>
        <li><b>Immune-tailored design:</b> The patent presumably considers human immunogenetic diversity, using computational MHC-binding predictions to include epitopes with broad HLA coverage.</li>

        <h4>CPGex: Cross-Cell Type Gene Expression Prediction Framework</h4>
        <p>The computational framework, <b>CPGex</b>, is designed to predict gene expression across different cell and tissue types. This approach leverages chromatin accessibility data and transcription factor-target gene (TF-TG) interactions, providing a novel method for gene expression prediction without relying on gene expression data from the target cell type.</p>
        <h4>üî¨ Computational Approach</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Chromatin Accessibility:</b> Data from cis-regulatory regions near the transcription start site (TSS) of genes.</li>
            <li><b>Transcription Factor Expression:</b> Expression levels of transcription factors predicted to regulate the gene of interest.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The model is trained using data from a diverse set of cell and tissue types, allowing it to generalize predictions to unseen cell types. This methodology is particularly advantageous when gene expression data for the target cell type is unavailable.</p>
        <h4>üåü Novelty</h4>
        <p>The novelty of CPGex lies in its ability to predict gene expression across cell types using only chromatin accessibility and transcription factor expression data. This approach addresses the challenge of limited gene expression data in certain cell types, enabling researchers to infer gene activity in these contexts. By focusing on regulatory mechanisms, CPGex provides insights into gene regulation that are not solely dependent on gene expression levels.</p>
        <h4>üß¨ Applications</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Cross-Cell Type Gene Expression Prediction:</b> Inferring gene expression in cell types where direct measurements are not available.</li>
            <li><b>Understanding Gene Regulation:</b> Identifying key transcription factors and regulatory regions influencing gene expression.</li>
            <li><b>Epigenomic Studies:</b> Exploring the relationship between chromatin accessibility and gene activity across different cell types.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Data Availability:</b> The accuracy of predictions depends on the quality and comprehensiveness of chromatin accessibility and transcription factor expression data.</li>
            <li><b>Model Generalization:</b> Ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen cell types requires diverse and representative training data.</li>
            <li><b>Interpretability:</b> Understanding the specific contributions of different features to predictions remains a complex task.</li>
